# soTILT3D
soTILT3D is a single-molecule super-resolution imaging platform that combines a single-objective dithered tilted light sheet with microfluidics, Exchange-PAINT, point spread function engineering, active stabilization, and deep learning for fast, accurate multitarget imaging in 3D throughout whole mammalian cells (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.27.559876). 

This repository contains the custom-written codes for red-to-green channel transformation, drift correction, slice-stitching, and the modified version of Easy-DHPSF compatible with analysis of the 12-Âµm range DH-PSF used throughout this work in "Analysis Codes and Procedures". Source data files for all graphs and plots throughout this work can be found in "Source Data File". 

All MATLAB codes were executed in MATLAB R2022b on a Windows10 64-bit operating system.
