This data is of fiducial beads imaged with the 12-um DHPSF in the red channel during imaging of LaminB1 in the green channel.
The "Left0umslice" in the name refers to the z position of the current slice that we were taking (0 um slice) and the "Left" refers to
us positioning the light sheet towards the left of the cell to gain some localizations on that side. We ended up not using this data set
in the final reconstruction of the multi-target nuclear lamina sample.
